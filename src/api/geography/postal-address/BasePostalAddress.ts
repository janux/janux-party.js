/**
 ***************************************************************************************************
 * Represents a Postal Address; this class aims to be independent of how an address may be
 * represented in an individual country;  StateProvince, Country and City are represented as objects
 * rather than strings; refer to the package documentation for biz.janux.geography for more
 * information on the relationship between City, StateProvince and Country
 * <p>
 * This interface also provides getCityAsstring, getStateProvinceAsstring, and getCountryAsstring so
 * that implementing classes can receive text values representing the geographical entities, for
 * example from a UI form. These methods can also be used in cases where it is not possible or
 * desirable to create the different geographical entities.  For example, it may be that the Country
 * is entered by-hand, rather than through a pick list, and may contain a spelling other than the
 * one that exists in the pre-populated Country tables.  In such case, it would not be desirable to
 * create a new Country entity for the different spellings, yet it is necessary to store whatever
 * string was entered for the Country.  In effect, via these methods it is possible to completely
 * bypass the use of the Geographical entities, if in a given implementation it is desirable or
 * necessary to store all address fields as text.
 * </p><p>
 * Finally, as a convenience feature, this interface provides the methods getCityName,
 * getStateProvinceCode, getStateProvinceName, and getCountryName, which makes it possible to
 * retrieve City, State, Country strings without concern as to whether these are stored as entities
 * or as simple strings
 * </p><p>
 * Note that the plan is to eventually make the 'Name' fields of the different geographical entities
 * localizable, For example, it may be necessary to display a City both as 'Munich' or 'Munchen',
 * depending on the language of the site.  Hence, rather than being a single-valued field, name
 * fields will be maps of strings keyed by Language, Country, and Variant code, in the usual java
 * way.  We foresee that such future implementation will still provide the ability to only use a
 * single language when desirable, and that the methods which do not specify a locale will be
 * interpreted to be requesting the default locale.
